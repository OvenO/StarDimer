\section{Introduction}
In this paper we introduce a short range resonating-valence-bond (SR-RVB), a.ka. a quantum dimer
model (QDM), on a square lattice that contains a $Z(3)$ local gauge structure. We use the term ``gauge
structure'' instead of ``gauge symmetry'' in accordance with Wen's comment in \cite{wen} suggesting
that the term ``gauge symmetry'' is confusing.  In the most basic hard core QDM the spins at the
vertices of the lattice are all paired into singlet states with one of their neighbors which can be
represented as a dimer. The over complete but simplest Hilbert space would be
that found by considering an Ising variable at each link on the lattice representing the presence or absence of a
dimer.  The operator $\hat{\sigma}^x_l$ acts on these links and has 
eigenvalues $\sigma_l = \pm 1$, where $\sigma_l$ is the
Ising variables of the $l^{\mathrm{th}}$ link on the lattice. The number operator for a give link is
defined as $\hat{n}_l \equiv (1+\hat{\sigma}_x)/2$ and counts the number of dimers on link $l$. The
number operator
can also be expressed in terms of the creation and annihilation operators at a link $d_l^+$ and
$d_l^-$ respectively as $\hat{n}_l \equiv d_l^+ d_l^-$. Since
$\hat{\sigma}$ has eigenvalues $\pm 1$, $n_l$ can be 1 or 0.  

In the fully packed QDM the Hilbert space must be properly restricted to satisfy the constraint that each vertex only
possesses one occupied link. We introduce a local operator $G_v$ that acts on a given vertex $v$ in such a
way that only the physical states are invariant under $G_v$. This operator is the local gauge
transformation. In general it can be defined as
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    G_v=e^{i \alpha (n_v - n_0)}
\end{equation}
%
where $n_0$ is the constrained number of dimers touching a vertex, $n_0=1$ in the QDM model, and
$n_v$ is the number of dimers at the $v^{\mathrm{th}}$ vertex defined in terms of the $n_l$ operator
as $n_v = \sum_{l\in v} n_l$. For the QDM $n_0 = 1$ and $n_v$ will only ever be 1 so $G_v =
e^{i\alpha (0)}$ and therefore $G_v$ leaves a physical state unchanged for any
$\alpha$ making the local gauge structure $U(1)$. 

Now we will introduce a relaxed constraint to the allowed number of dimers touching a vertex, namely we allow
$n_v = 1$ or $n_v = 4$. When $n_v=1$ it is the usual QDM picture of one link at a vertex being
occupied.  
Given this relaxed
constraint we propose a new local gauge transformation that leaves the physical states invariant
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    G_v = e^{i (\hat{n}_v -1) 2\pi/3}    
\end{equation}
%
The new possibility of $n_v = 4$ is what reduces the local gauge structure from $U(1)$ to $Z(3)$. 

Shortly we will define the Hamiltonian that describes a system that contains $n_v =1,4$ but for now
we state that we set the coefficient of the kinetic and potential terms equal to each other so that
it the model is at the RK point.  At the RK point the ground state is the short-range resonating
valence bond state which also includes these new four link occupied vertices
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    \left| \Psi \right\rangle = \sum_{\{C\}} \left| C \right\rangle
    ,
\end{equation}
% 
where $\{C\}$ is the set of fully packed configurations. The physical states invariance under $G_v$
can now be written as 
\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    G_v \left| \Psi \right\rangle = \left| \Psi \right\rangle
    .
\end{equation}


To understand the local gauge structure we will map the idea of a dimer constraint to a flux
constraint. The square lattice contains two sublattices. We imagine that one sublattice has arrows
on the links pointing towards the vertices and the other sublattice arrows on the links are pointing
away from the vertices. A dimer couping a link that connects two vertices, one from each sublattice,
amounts to a unit of flux in the direction of the arrow. Therefore in the QDM each vertex has a flux
of $\pm 1$ which can be thought of as a background charge of
$\pm 1$ on each vertex, the sign determined by the sublattice. When the constraint is relaxed and $n_v =4$ is
allowed it is equivalent to doping the system with objects carrying charge $\pm 3$. 
In general a $U(1)$ gauge theory describes low-energy strong local correlations.
Coupling a $U(1)$ gauge field to a charge $N$ matter field reduces the gauge structure to a $Z(N)$ 
field \cite{fradkin and shenker}. For our model the matter field $U(1)$ is coupled to is
charge $N=3$ and results in a $Z(N)$ field.

Now we want to define a Hamiltonian that commutes with $G_v$. First we must consider the dynamics of the
$n_v = 4$ objects on the lattice.
The Hamiltonian of the quantum dimer model is split into the resonance term and the diagonal term. The
resonance term being the kinetic energy term and the diagonal term being the potential energy term
diagonal term being the potential energy term.
\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    H = H_{\mathrm{res}} + H_{\mathrm{diag}}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    H_{\mathrm{res}} = -t\sum_{\bplqt} 
        \left(
            \left|
                \vp
            \right\rangle
            \left\langle
                \hp
            \right|
            +
            \mathrm{h.c.}
        \right)
\end{equation}

\noindent
and 

\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    H_{\mathrm{diag}} = v\sum_{\bplqt}
        \left(
            \left|
                \vp
            \right\rangle
            \left\langle
                \vp
            \right|
            +
            \left|
                \hp{}
            \right\rangle
            \left\langle
                \hp
            \right|
        \right)
\end{equation}

The sum over $p$ is the sum over all plaquettes on the lattice.

In the star dimer model we introduce the additional potential and kinetic energy terms. The dotted
lines represent places where there \textit{must} be \textit{no} dimer. If there is no dimer and no
dotted line it means that location may either be occupied or unoccupied as long as the rules for allowed number
of occupied links per vertex are obeyed. We also use the blank doted symbols in the sum but this is
to denote the appropriate gometries that must be sumed over. First the
creation and annihilation along with the pair potential energy

\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    H_{\mathrm{star\ pair\ res}} = a\sum_{\bstr}
        \left(
            \left|
                \hprs
            \right\rangle
            \left\langle
                \hspr
            \right|
            +
            \mathrm{h.c.}
        \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    H_{\mathrm{star\ pair\ diag}} = a\sum_{\bstr}
        \left(
            \left|
                \hprs
            \right\rangle
            \left\langle
                \hprs

                \hspr
            \right|
        \right)
\end{equation}

\noindent
Now the horizonal propagation and potential energy terms

\begin{equation}

            +
            \mathrm{h.c.}
        \right)

\begin{equation}

    H_{\mathrm{star\ horizontal\ move\ diag}} = a\sum_{\bhrzmv}
        \left(
            \left|

            \right|

The vertical constituent is just the horizontal terms rotated by $\pi/2$. The upper left to lower

%The Rokhsar-Kivelson quantum dimer model \cite{HERE}, a short range resonating-valence-bond (RVB)
%model, has been thoroughly studied since its introduction in 1988. The prevalence of the model is
%partly attributed to the ability to sample the groundstate wave function simplicity and partly to the interesting properties it shows
%when considered in different lattice geometries. The

%i.e. the norm of $\Psi$ is the partition function of the classical dimer model.



%On the square lattice the dimer dimer correlation function at the RK point (coefficient in front of
%kinetic energy is equal to the coefficient in front of potential energy $t-v$) was solved exactly by Fisher and
%Stephenson in 1963. They showed that correlations decay as $1/r^2$. This algebraic decay means that
%ground state has no long
%range dimer order (not a crystal). It is not a liquid either. In a liquid correlations decay
%exponentially.

\section{Dimer Model}

\subsection{Correlation Functions}

Here we check the implementation of our numerical methods. First we validate that the dimer pair
correlations in a fully packed dimer model decay as $1/r^2$. Second we validate that the monomer
pair (defect) correlations in a fully packed dimer model decay as $1/r^{1/2}$ ($1/r^{1/3}$ in the
fully packed loop model). In fig. \ref{fig:dimer_dimer_cor} we show a histogram of the correlation
function 
\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    C_{dimer}(0,r) = \langle s_0 s_r \rangle -\langle s_0 \rangle \langle s_r \rangle
\end{equation}

\noindent
for a lattice size of $64\times 64$ The disconnected piece of the correlation function is

\begin{equation}
    \label{}
    \langle s_0 \rangle \langle s_r \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16}.
\end{equation}

\noindent
The connected component is calculated numerically, in this case, $s_0$ is the value of the link at the
right of the $(0,0)$ vertex and $s_r$ are only chosen from the same vertical column of links.
In fig. \ref{fig:dimer_dimer_cor_log} we show a log log plot of the relevent half of the data
shown in fig. \ref{fig:dimer_dimer_cor}. 

We now look at the same correlation function on a $128\times128$ lattice.
Using a weighted fit of on points $[3,13]$, shown in fig.
\ref{fig:fit_dm_dm_128x128} we find the slope of the line to be $-2.4203\pm 0.0106$.

Now the correlation function on a $256\times256$ lattice.
Using a weighted fit of on points $[3,14]$, shown in fig.
\ref{fig:fit_dm_dm_256x256} we find the slope of the line to be $2.3057\pm 0.0269$.

In these figures %\ref{fig:mult_slps_dm_dm_64x64,fig:mult_slps_dm_dm_128x128,fig:mult_slps_dm_dm_256x256}
we plot the weighted fit slope for a variety of histogram bin selections. The
histogram bins used in the fit are chosen in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A cut off point in the histograms is chosen such that all the histogram bins beyond this
        point have errors that are too large to justify including them in a fit.
    \item All histogram bins until the cut off are used in a weighted fit. This is plotted as the first
        point with error bars that are the error of the fit.
    \item The first histogram bin is omitted from the fit.
    \item The second histogram bin is omitted from the fit.
    \item ...

Creation and annihilation of a horizontal pair of stars is shown in fig.

Horizontal translations of a star is shown in fig. \ref{fig:move_right_left}. The vertical
translations can be obtained by rotating fig. \ref{fig:move_right_left} by $\pi/2$. Horizontal
translations must be preformed such that the star remains on its original sub-lattice, thus the
minimal translation is by two vertices.

\subsection{Equilibration Time}

We show three order parameters as a function of Monte Carlo time, $t_{mc}$: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of stars.
    \item The difference between the number of vertical dimers and horizontal dimers.
    \item The number of flippable plaquetts.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
in fig. \ref{fig:nums_of_things}. We define $t_{mc}$ to be $2lh$ local updates, where $l$ is the length of the system and $h$ is the
height of the system in number of vertices. This lattice size used was $64\times 64$. Each data
point shown is the average over 100 different simulations. The error bars are the standard deviations of
the counts used in taking the mean. It appears as if the equilibration time is around $400t_{mc}$.

The following statistics are given for different lattice sizes but each set of data is found using
100,000 bins, each an average over 10 measurements, each measurement taken after $1\times t_{mc}$.
We have not included the first 400 $t_{mc}$ so that the averages are found in an equilibrated

\subsection{Translational Symmetry Breaking}

On an $8\times 8$ lattice we find that there is always some residual asymmetry in the horizontal
dimers (speculation:) due to the initial configuration of dimers. This appears to be an effect of
small system size as the $16\times 16$ lattice looks to be transnationally invariant.

\subsection{Old Moves and Rules}

Creating a pair of stars in the staggered state is shown in fig. \ref{fig:old_create_pair}. We notice
the creation of a star produces two flippable plaquettes between the two stars.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8.5 cm]{old_create_pair}
    \caption{The creation of a pair of stars in the fully packed staggered configuration. The red
    dots on the $x$ and $y$ axes show the dimer about which the stars are created.
\label{fig:old_create_pair}}
\end{figure}

\noindent In fig. \ref{fig:old_move_right} we show the rightmost star move right in the same
configuration. In any single star must remain on the sublattice it was created on, so the center of
the star moves by two vertices. We notice that the horizontal propagation of a star creates two boundaries of
flippable plaquettes across the top and bottom of the star pair.

    \includegraphics[width=8.5 cm]{old_move_right}
    \caption{The move of the rightmost star in fig. \ref{fig:old_create_pair} \label{fig:old_move_right}}
\end{figure}

Still figuring out the possible ways to move stars vertically. In six steps we show it is possible
to implement a specific type of local vertical move. 
\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Step 1 (fig. \ref{fig:ex_vert_mv_1}): create a pair of stars.
    
    \item 
    Step 2 (fig. \ref{fig:ex_vert_mv_2}): Move rightmost star right four times creating a horizontal set of
    flippable plaquettes.
    
    \item
    Step 3 (fig. \ref{fig:ex_vert_mv_3}): Flip some of the plaquettes. 
    
    \item
    Step 4 (fig. \ref{fig:ex_vert_mv_4}): With several vertical pairs of dimers we can flip on plaquette to make a
    horizontal pair that was not part of the original set of horizontal dimers after the star move. The
    $x$ and $y$ positions of this plaquette are marked in fig. \ref{fig:ex_vert_mv_4} by red dots along the $x$ and $y$
    axes. If all of the dimers were left as vertical or horizontal the move would not be possible.
    
    \item
    Step 5 (fig. \ref{fig:ex_vert_mv_5}): Create another pair of stars.
    
    \item
    Step 6 (fig. \ref{fig:ex_vert_mv_6}): Move the rightmost star of the new pair up. When this is done
    the dimers must be rearranged to satisfy the packing conditions and conserve the number of dimers.
    Right now this is the only configuration I see for this move that can satisfy these conditions.
\end{itemize}
